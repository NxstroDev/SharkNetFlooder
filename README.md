# SharkNetFlooder
It's a simple flooder script in python with a nice colorful interface that looks a bit like a botnet (I used the same interface as on my qbot SharkNet Notnet botnet). Use a dedicated vps or server under linux for better use and power.

Login for use the script ---> User = "Root" and Password = "root" or "azerty1337"
